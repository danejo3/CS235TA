# Introduction: #

Hi! My name is Dane and I have been working as a CS 235 TA for the past 3.5
years. Currently, I am responsible to make sure the driver is running for
Brother Roper. In this README file, I will document the history of the
driver and what I plan on doing with the driver during fall 2019 semester.



# History of The Driver: #

Ever since Brother Roper began teaching CS 235 in Fall 2017, Brother Roper's
goal was to relieve the responsibility of TAs passing off students by creating
an automatic online pass-off driver. By creating this driver, essentially the
driver would allow the TAs to spend more time with the students and avoid long
pass-off lines that hundreds of students complained about in the past.

The first person that began this long arduous project was Mike Liddle.
The first time I've ever saw and met Mike was during a TA meeting; it was also 
the last time that I'd ever see him. I wasn't particularly close with him, nor did I know him personally, but I do remember Brother Roper telling us what Mike did while we
were helping the students.

Basically, the reason why I never saw him again was because after a few 
month(s)?, he decided to quit. I'm not sure exactly when and why he chose
to quit but the driver was far from complete. Due to the incompleteness
of the driver and the need to get it done before the upcoming winter semester, 
Brother Roper asked Stephen Leach, who was the head TA at the time, to pick up where Mike left off.

Quickly realizing how much there was to do between being the head TA and working on the far-from-complete driver, Stephen was swamped. Throughout the entire semester, I remember
Stephen asking me questions about Python because the driver was originally written
in Python by Mike. Because Python was not Stephen's strongest language, the end result was a barely functional mess. After seeing what a mess it was, Brother Roper asked Stephen to rewrite the entire driver for Winter Semester over Christmas break --which he did. (Poor Stephen...)

Miraculously, Stephen was able to rewrite the entire driver during winter
break and we launched his live prototype in Winter 2018. 

Although the pass-off driver was far from perfect and changes were made throughout
the semester, it got the job done and truly helped the students receive more time 
with the TAs. (Yay Stephen!!!)

After using Stephen's pass-off driver for almost a year, Stephen decided to
quit fall 2018. It was a dark time for all the TAs... Because I was the 'eldest' TA
and understood some Python, Stephen knew I was the next best candidate to take over his legacy. So here I was, left with a semi-broken driver in the middle of winter semester, left alone to frantically understand Stephen's code and resolve critical issues that plagued the student's submissions. 

It was hard. 

Ever since Stephen left, I've been fixing and polishing the driver along with 
Matthew Cox--the former head TA. Due to the complexity of the driver's code,
Matthew and I decided that it would best if we only fix or add code when necessary.
After fixing a lot of problems with the driver throughout winter semester, we were
able to get the driver relatively stable.

As of today, the day I'm writing this blurb, the driver is still far from perfect
but has been running a lot more smoothly than the past. Because this is my last
semester as a CS 235 TA, my goal is to document and comment as much as I can before
I leave and hope that whoever comes across this will benefit from what I have
learned over the past year.

*Cheers*
